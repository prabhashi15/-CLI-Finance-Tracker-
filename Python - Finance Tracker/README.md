## Challenges Faced Without Finance Tracker :

1. Without a finance tracker, individuals may struggle to create and stick to a budget. 

2. Identifying where money is being spent becomes challenging without a systematic tracking mechanism. This lack of awareness can lead to overspending and difficulties in cutting unnecessary expenses.

3. Many individuals may not have a clear understanding of their overall financial health, including net income, net worth, and spending patterns.

4. Recognizing spending patterns and trends over time becomes challenging without a tool that can analyze and present financial data in a meaningful way.

5. Financial uncertainty and lack of control over one's financial situation can contribute to stress and anxiety. 


## Challenge Faced While Implementing:

1. I didn't know about the JSON library, so I had to do research to find out about it.

2. I faced difficulties while downloading the python version required for this.

3. Managing file operations,such as saving and loading data to and from files.

4. Identifying and fixing bugs in the code,ensuring the program behaves as expected.
